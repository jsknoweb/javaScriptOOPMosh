Avoid creating inheritance hierarchies
Do not do more than one level of inheritance !!

KEEP IT SIMPLE
FAVOR COMPOSITION OVER INHERITANCE 

Example:

COMPLEX INHERITANCE

                ANIMAL
                eat()

            MAMMAL        FISH
            walk()        swim()

        PERSON  DOG      GOLDFISH


COMPOSITION

    canWalk         canEat          canSwim

    PERSON      GOLDFISH    ...
