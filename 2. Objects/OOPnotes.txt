4 pillars of object-oriented programming
	- Encapsulation
	- Abstraction
	- Inheritance
	- Polymorphism
	
Encapsulation -> We group related variables and functions that operate of them into objects.
	Attributes and behaviour (Properties and methods)

	"The best functions are those with no parameters!" Uncle Bob - Robert C Martin
	
	Benefits:
		- Reduce complexity
		- Increase reusability

Abstraction -> We hide most of the variables and functions of an object and make public a simple
	interface to  interact with.
	Benefits:
		- Reduce complexity -> Simpler interface	
		- Reduce the Impact of Change
	
Inheritance -> It's a mechanism that allows us to eliminate redundance code.
	Benefits:
		- Eliminate redundant code.
		

Polymorphism -> It's a mechanism that allows us to get ride of long if and else or swith case statements.
	Benefits:
		- Refactor ugly switch/case statements.
